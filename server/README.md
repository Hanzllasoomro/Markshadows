# Server

This folder contains the backend server for Markshadows.

## Features
- Node.js backend
- Express.js server (handles HTTP requests and API endpoints)
- Manages authentication and user sessions
- Connects to a database (add details if used, e.g., MongoDB)
- Serves as the API for the frontend client

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

The server will start on the port defined in your environment variables or default to 5000. Make sure to set up a `.env` file for environment-specific variables (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).

## Project Structure

- `package.json` - Project metadata and scripts
- `.env` - Environment variables (not committed to version control)
